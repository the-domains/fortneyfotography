# [The New Fortney Fotography Website!][0]

Well, here we are - a first post for our new website, and we're 
excited! And, we are excited that you have found us and are checking us out!  First let me state that my wife, Crystal, and I are looking forward to serving you as we build our sideline photography business.

I say "sideline" because we are both 
currently employed with 40+ hour jobs, but our passion for photography, 
and continued nudging by friends and family, have led us in exploration 
down this path. For now, our plan is that this will be a part-time 
venture for us, but we hope to one day make it more.

Even though this is part-time,
we take this venture very seriously, and want to do the very best for 
you. Our strong desire is to capture life's images, and maybe create and capture some precious moments, 
in such a way that you will be proud to place them on your walls.  There is no greater compliment to our work than that! 

For the near future, we plan to continue to build our portfolio in 
order to present a wide selection of our capabilities to you visually 
via this website and other social media (Facebook, our blog, etc.) Eventually, we plan to have our own website developed under our own domain name, fortneyfotography.com (obtained and registered).  

For now, we are pursuing those in need of 
senior, engagement, maternity, newborn, and family photographs. 
Although this list is where we'd like to focus for now, we are still 
interested in other avenues as well, such as motorcycle events or 
landscapes (personal favorites of mine). And, if you have anything else
in mind that you'd like to explore with us, please feel free to contact
us! We 
are in the process of developing our pricing scheme, but until that is announced, we have been working pro bono.  

In addition, we are on the verge of making this business a legitimate business through the required agencies.  That will be announced when it is finalized.

Best wishes,  
__Larry and Crystal Fortney
